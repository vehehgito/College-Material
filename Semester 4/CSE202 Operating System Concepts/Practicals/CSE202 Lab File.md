##### Experiment 1: Use of basic shell commands

In computing, a shell is a program that provides a command-line interface to interact with an operating system. Basic shell commands are a set of simple and essential commands that are used frequently to perform various operations in a shell.

Here are some examples of basic shell commands and what they do:

1. cd: This command is used to change the current working directory. For example, cd Documents would change the current directory to the "Documents" folder.

2. ls: This command is used to list the contents of a directory. For example, ls -l would list the contents of the current directory in a long format.

3. mkdir: This command is used to create a new directory. For example, mkdir NewFolder would create a new folder named "NewFolder".

4. rm: This command is used to remove files or directories. For example, rm file.txt would delete a file named "file.txt".

5. cp: This command is used to copy files or directories. For example, cp file1.txt file2.txt would create a copy of "file1.txt" and name it "file2.txt".

6. mv: This command is used to move or rename files or directories. For example, mv file1.txt Documents/ would move "file1.txt" to the "Documents" directory.

7. echo: This command is used to display a message on the screen. For example, echo "Hello, World!" would display the message "Hello, World!" on the screen.
